Hi! Welcome to Atompunk78's BeamNG Track Generator, I hope you enjoy it!

To use the program:
 - Set the 'savePath' section in the config file to the location of BeamNG's 'trackEditor' folder
 - Run the program using Python.
 
This will generate one track with the default parameters. If you want to generate multiple tracks at once, set 'overwriteTracks' to 'False' then run the program multiple times.
You can change the parameters to make it generate different types of tracks. Occasionally the generated tracks will cross over themselves (or otherwise be invalid), if this happens just generate a new one.
NB the correct savePath will change every major BeamNG update, and that backslashes (\) aren't allowed in the config file; use forward slashes (/) instead.
The tracks are designed to be played on Small Grid Map rather than the default Glow City.
If you're struggling with anything message me and I'll almost certainly be able to help.

Kindly note there's a licence attached to the program. It basically says:
 - You can freely distribute it as long as it is unmodified and you give credit
 - You can't profit off of it

I'm flexible on these, so if the above is a problem just send me a message!

I hope you like the program, have fun :)
